# Eye Tracking Implementation Fixes

This document summarizes all the fixes and improvements made to the eye tracking websocket implementation in the Prepwise project.

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Missing Dependencies**
- **Issue**: The `playsound` library was causing errors and wasn't necessary
- **Fix**: Removed `playsound` dependency from `requirements.txt`
- **Impact**: Eliminates startup errors and reduces dependencies

### 2. **Python Backend Improvements**
- **Issue**: Poor error handling and resource management
- **Fixes**:
  - Added comprehensive logging with proper error handling
  - Improved resource cleanup (video capture, threads)
  - Added health check endpoint (`/api/health`)
  - Better WebSocket configuration with threading mode
  - Added frame rate limiting to prevent system overload
  - Enhanced cheating detection with attempt counting

### 3. **Frontend WebSocket Issues**
- **Issue**: Poor connection management and error handling
- **Fixes**:
  - Added connection status indicators
  - Implemented proper socket cleanup on component unmount
  - Added reconnection logic with configurable attempts
  - Better error messages and user feedback
  - Added cheating attempt counter display
  - Improved video feed display with loading states

### 4. **API Route Improvements**
- **Issue**: Basic error handling and Windows compatibility issues
- **Fixes**:
  - Added health check before starting backend
  - Improved Windows/Unix compatibility
  - Better error handling and timeout management
  - Added verification that backend started successfully
  - Created dedicated stop-python API route

### 5. **Component Naming Consistency**
- **Issue**: Inconsistent naming between `WebCamStream` and `WebcamStream`
- **Fix**: Standardized to `WebCamStream` throughout the codebase

### 6. **TypeScript Error Handling**
- **Issue**: TypeScript errors with unknown error types
- **Fix**: Added proper type annotations for all error catch blocks

## New Features Added

### 1. **Setup Scripts**
- `backend/setup.py` - Python setup script with environment verification
- `backend/setup.bat` - Windows batch script for easy setup
- `backend/setup.sh` - Unix shell script for easy setup

### 2. **Health Monitoring**
- Health check endpoint to verify backend status
- Connection status indicators in the UI
- Automatic backend verification on startup

### 3. **Enhanced User Experience**
- Real-time connection status display
- Cheating attempt counter
- Better loading states and error messages
- Improved video feed quality

### 4. **Documentation**
- Comprehensive `backend/README.md` with setup instructions
- Troubleshooting guide for common issues
- Platform-specific setup instructions

## Files Modified

### Backend Files
- `backend/eye_gaze.py` - Complete rewrite with improvements
- `backend/requirements.txt` - Removed playsound dependency
- `backend/setup.py` - New setup script
- `backend/setup.bat` - Windows setup script
- `backend/setup.sh` - Unix setup script
- `backend/README.md` - Comprehensive documentation

### Frontend Files
- `components/WebCamStream.tsx` - Complete rewrite with better error handling
- `components/Agent.tsx` - Fixed import and error handling
- `app/api/start-python/route.ts` - Enhanced with health checks
- `app/api/stop-python/route.ts` - New dedicated stop route

### Documentation
- `README.md` - Added eye tracking setup instructions
- `EYE_TRACKING_FIXES.md` - This summary document

## Setup Instructions

### Quick Setup (Windows)
```bash
cd backend
setup.bat
```

### Quick Setup (Unix/macOS)
```bash
cd backend
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

### Manual Setup
```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python setup.py
```

## Testing the Fixes

1. **Start the frontend**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Navigate to an interview page**

3. **Verify the eye tracking starts automatically**:
   - Should see "Starting eye tracking service..." message
   - Connection status should show "Connected"
   - Video feed should appear

4. **Test error scenarios**:
   - Disconnect webcam to test error handling
   - Close browser tab to test cleanup
   - Restart backend to test reconnection

## Performance Improvements

- **Reduced CPU usage** with frame rate limiting
- **Better memory management** with proper cleanup
- **Improved reliability** with health checks and reconnection
- **Enhanced user feedback** with status indicators

## Security Considerations

- All processing happens locally
- No sensitive data transmitted
- WebSocket communication limited to localhost
- Video frames are base64 encoded for transmission

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Could not open webcam"**
   - Run `python setup.py` to verify webcam access
   - Check webcam permissions in OS settings
   - Ensure no other app is using the webcam

2. **Connection refused errors**
   - Check if port 5000 is available
   - Restart the backend manually: `python eye_gaze.py`
   - Verify Python dependencies are installed

3. **Import errors**
   - Run the setup script: `python setup.py`
   - Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed
   - Check virtual environment if using one

### Platform-Specific Issues

**Windows**:
- Use `python` instead of `python3`
- Run PowerShell as Administrator if needed
- Ensure Python is in PATH

**macOS**:
- Grant camera permissions to Terminal/VS Code
- Use `python3` command
- Install Xcode command line tools if needed

**Linux**:
- Install system dependencies: `sudo apt-get install python3-opencv`
- Ensure webcam permissions: `sudo usermod -a -G video $USER`

## Future Improvements

1. **Configuration Options**: Add settings for sensitivity and detection parameters
2. **Multiple Camera Support**: Support for external webcams
3. **Advanced Analytics**: More detailed cheating detection metrics
4. **Mobile Support**: Optimize for mobile devices
5. **Accessibility**: Add options for users with disabilities

## Conclusion

The eye tracking implementation has been significantly improved with:

- ✅ Robust error handling and recovery
- ✅ Better user experience with status indicators
- ✅ Comprehensive setup and documentation
- ✅ Cross-platform compatibility
- ✅ Proper resource management
- ✅ Enhanced security and privacy

The system is now production-ready and provides a reliable foundation for interview monitoring with real-time eye tracking capabilities.
